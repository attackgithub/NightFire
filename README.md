## Disclaimer
NightFire is a Proof of Concept toolkit, and should not be used against anything but your own computers, or computers you've been given explicit permission to use the toolkit on. NightFire is considered "weaponized", and has no safeguards to prevent damage once infection has been triggered. If you misuse it and get a knock on your door, it's not my fault.
